We have designed an innovative search engine interface for users to easily get access to TV shows and movie information. Our search allows users to discover new and old shows and movies that contain similarities to their own favourites. The site takes movie and TVshow names as input as well as some criteria on how accurate the user wants their recommendations to be. This project is not only simple but it is effective and can actually come in handy when trying to find a new show or movie to watch. Post hackathon, my team and I plan on turning the website into an extension that could be clicked at any time to get information on videos you might be watching online and give recommendations based on more complex factors such as age, gender, region and time of day.
